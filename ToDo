what do I want with the AI training project? - this is the structure that I want to share in the thesis!!!

- in Python
	- create a framework on GitHub that has
		- separate training codes that can be run
	- the project tree should look like the following:
		- README
			-> this should include a general overview of the whole project
		- data
		    - Here I want to have diverse datasets for validation and training
		    - The num of inputs shall be decreased
        - trained_models
            - GRU
            - LSTM
            - Simple RNN
            - Transformer
            - TCN
        - code
		    - classes.py
		    - training_code:
		        - training_debug.ipynb
		            -> this is for debugging purposes only
                - training_GRU.py
                - training_LSTM.py
                - training_RNN.py
                - training_T.py
                - training_TCN.py
                    -> These (except the notebook) should be ready to run on OTB without modification
                    -> The hyperparameters should be stored in a separate file -> during testing these should be reachable
                        
            - testing_code:
		        - testing_debug.ipynb
                - testing_general.py
			        - requirements
			            - this should load in all the models that were created
			            - run them on the testing datasets
			            - the estimated values shall be stored
			            - performance measures shall be calculated on all the estimations
                        - it shall be possible to run the tests on multiple models -> to be able to just run it and wait for the results
			-> this should be a universal code that can test whichever model I choose

- in Matlab
    - create the data for training
        - normalization has to be added to check whether it makes a difference


location of the training project: where should it be?
    - work laptop
        - only editing everything that I have
    - GitHub
        - purpose: to have a central place for all the code
        - everything except the created models
    - SVN
        - the code here must be correct and tested, and no debugging should be done here
        - storing the created models + the training code
        - this is mainly for OTB


I still have to come up with the requirements - not solved
    - this has to be calculated from the slips -> there are requirements for the slips from which I can calculate back the speed tolerance
    - these requirements are crucial for the project -> what am I aiming for?
    -

Documentation - solved
    - I should start using an offline one to be able to insert the images
    - overleaf is still good for editing sections and storing the whole project with the images
    - For exporting the whole document, I can use an offline editor on my laptop
