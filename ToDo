what do I want with the AI training?

- in Python
	- create a framework on GitHub that has
		- separate training codes that can be run
	- the project tree should look like the following:
		- README
			-> this should include a general overview of the whole project
		- data
		    - Here I want to have diverse datasets for validation and training
		    - The num of inputs shall be decreased
		- GRU
		- LSTM
		- Simple RNN
		- Transformer
		- classes.py
		- training_GRU.py
		- training_LSTM.py
		- training_RNN.py
		- training_T.py
		- testing.py
			-> this should be a universal code that can test whichever model I choose


location of the training project: where should it be?
    - work laptop
        - not storing anything on it
    - GitHub
        - purpose: to have a central place for all the code
        - everything except the created models
    - SVN
        - storing the created models + the training code
        - this is mainly for OTB


I still have to come up with the requirements
    - this has to be calculated from the slips -> there are requirements for the slips from which I can calculate back the speed tolerance
    - these requirements are crucial for the project -> what am I aiming for?
    -

Documentation
    - I should start using an offline one to be able to insert the images
    - overleaf is still good for editing sections
    - I should start using GitHub to be able to use it anywhere
